                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Task description:</h4>
                <p>The Scratch project was my first game project that I had to create during my programming studies at PXL University College. The name of my assignment was "Scratch," and it was a Pong game.</p>
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> Personal challenges:</h4>
                <p>It was quite difficult to create such an app at the beginning of my studies, especially since I hadn’t had any lessons on this topic yet. I had to search a lot to get everything working. The simplicity of the task offered little room to try new techniques or add something unique.</p>
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> What I have learned:</h4>
                <p> I learned that I need to work independently, search a lot, and solve problems on my own within IT. This project motivated me and sparked an interest for future challenges.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Task description:</h4>
                    <p>The task is to organize my weekly schedule, making sure that I balance lessons, personal time, studying, and other activities. I have tracked my time for a week to ensure efficient management of my daily tasks. </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> Personal challenges:</h4>
                    <p>A major challenge was creating a schedule that included all my necessary tasks while also ensuring I have enough time for rest and leisure. It required me to balance academic responsibilities (38 hours of class time) with other activities such as personal study time, meals, and family or hobby time. Finding the right balance took a lot of trial and error and thoughtful planning. </p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> What I have learned:</h4>
                    <p>It taught me how to prioritize tasks and allocate time wisely. I now understand better how to avoid overloading myself and ensure there is enough time for both work and relaxation. This exercise improved my ability to organize my week and helped me focus on what’s most important at the right times.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Task description:</h4>
                    <p> The task was to create a Mastermind game using C# and XAML. The game generates a random code that the player must guess within 10 attempts.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> Personal challenges:</h4>
                    <p> The app was quite complex, and there was a lot of new information that I had to apply simultaneously to make the app function properly. It was challenging to bring all the different components together effectively.</p>
                    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> What I have learned:</h4>
                    <p>This project improved my skills in C# and XAML and taught me how to solve problems that arose during the development process.</p>
