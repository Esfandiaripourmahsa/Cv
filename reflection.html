      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        During the Scratch project, my biggest challenge was learning how to develop an application independently without prior lessons. I struggled to structure my work because the simplicity of the task left little room for creativity. By searching, experimenting, and solving problems on my own, I developed essential skills that I could apply in other projects. This project also taught me how important it is to stay curious and determined, even when tasks seem difficult.

      <h2>Insights from the POP session</h2>
      <p>
        In the POP session, I learned how important it is to break my work into small, achievable steps. This helps me stay focused during projects. I also discovered how reflecting on what went well and what could be improved helps me grow as a programmer.

      <h2>Applying this in daily life as a programmer</h2>
      <p>
        I apply what I’ve learned by dividing my projects into smaller steps and setting priorities. This allows me to better plan my work and keep an overview. I also take time to reflect on what I can improve. Continuously searching for solutions independently is a skill I will keep practicing to become more self-reliant.

      <h2>X-factor Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(Em)passion:</strong> During the Scratch project, I discovered my passion for programming and game development. By persevering, I achieved my first success, which strengthened my interest in the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrepreneurial & Innovative:</strong> The project taught me to solve problems independently and to spot opportunities for self-improvement. Despite Scratch’s simplicity, I was able to experiment and think of creative ways to personalize my project.</li>
        <li><strong>(International) Collaboration:</strong> Although Scratch was an individual project, I realized the importance of a supportive network. In the future, I aim to collaborate more with others to exchange ideas and grow further.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi- & Disciplinarity:</strong> This project gave me a first glimpse into how different disciplines – such as logic, creativity, and user experience – come together in programming work.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Although the project was small, it was a sustainable investment in my future. The skills and mindset I developed will continue to support me in future challenges.</li>
